# Dyslexia-Friendly Learning Platform

## The Problem
For millions of people with dyslexia, reading and writing can be a constant struggle. Traditional learning methods often don't address visual processing and phonetic challenges, leading to frustration and academic barriers.

## The Solution
Our project is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to make learning more accessible and engaging for students with dyslexia. Beyond simple text formatting, our platform will include interactive **lessons** to build foundational literacy skills and a **dashboard** to track progress.

Key features will include:
* **Settings:** Customizable fonts (like OpenDyslexic), spacing, and color overlays to reduce visual strain.
* **Speech-to-Text:** A feature that allows students to speak words and see them appear as text, helping with spelling and word retrieval.
* **Text-to-Speech:** A tool to read text aloud, assisting with reading comprehension and pronunciation.

## Technologies Used
Our core application will be built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. For the speech features, we will integrate a cloud-based **Text-to-Speech (TTS) API** and **Speech-to-Text (STT) API** to handle the heavy lifting.

## Plan for the Hackathon
Given the limited time, our focus is to build a strong proof-of-concept for the core functionality. Our plan is to:
* **Phase 1:** Build the user interface for the main dashboard and settings page.
* **Phase 2:** Implement the **custom font and spacing settings** to demonstrate the accessibility features.
* **Phase 3:** Integrate a basic **Speech-to-Text API** to show the innovative learning potential.
