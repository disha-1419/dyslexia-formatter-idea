# Dyslexia-Friendly Text Formatter

## The Problem
For millions of people with dyslexia, reading online can be a constant struggle. Default fonts and cramped spacing make words feel scrambled, leading to fatigue and frustration.

## The Solution
Our project is a simple, web-based tool that makes any digital text instantly dyslexia-friendly. It will allow users to adjust fonts (like OpenDyslexic) and control spacing to create a more comfortable reading experience.

## Plan for the Hackathon
* **Phase 1 (Core Functionality):** Build a basic HTML page with a text input and output. Use JavaScript to update the output as the user types.
* **Phase 2 (Formatting):** Add CSS classes for a dyslexia-friendly font and increased spacing, and create buttons to toggle these features on and off.
* **Phase 3 (Final Touches):** Refine the user interface and make sure the tool is responsive and easy to use.
